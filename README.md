## Discussion

This project is a practice in using full stack web dev tools. It is hosted for free at Heroku and accesses the Mailchimp API to manage email campaigns. 

The tools used to build this site are HTML, SCSS, Node.js, and JavaScript. For this project I used VScode and pushed my commits to github. Heroku is able to auto update changes when pushes are made to Github.

My goal was to practice UX/UI skills, and gain exposure to building a backend. I also wanted to become more familiar with using APIs and using json packets.  

I first designed the site using CSS but later converted it to SCSS to become more familiar with it. 

There is some JavaScript used to control the gallery slides.  

This site functions as expected.  
It is a fairly basic build, but it was a good place to start.  
I used postman to test my API connections which was very useful.  
The site is slow to load, and I believe this is due to Heroku's free hosting.  
I do not plan to update this site any further but will instead start a new project from scratch.
